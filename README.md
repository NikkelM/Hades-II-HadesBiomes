# Hades underworld run in Hades II

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the [FAQ in the wiki](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki) with any questions before opening an issue.

This mod adds biomes and enemies from Hades to Hades II, as a third route.

> The mod is still early in development, and not everything might work as expected.

> [!WARNING]
> I do not recommend using this mod on any "real" saves during this WIP period.
> It's recommended to use a save file dedicated to testing or developing mods, and to create a backup of all save files before using the mod.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this mod you _must_ have Hades installed on your system when playing Hades II.
You should not uninstall Hades after installing the mod, as the mod will not work without it.

It is recommended to have both Hades and Hades II installed through the same platform (e.g. both through Steam or both through Epic)/in the same parent directory.

> [!CAUTION]
> To be able to use the mod, Hades must be installed at **ALL TIMES**.

Read on at [Installation](#installation) for information on how to install the mod through r2modman.
