*Zagreus' Journey* is a mod for Hades II that adds the original route Zagreus took through Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx in the first game to the sequel. <br>
Escape the Underworld as Melinoë, battle familiar foes and bosses using her unique abilities and weapons, meet Zagreus' old friends, and reconnect with your family's past.

Wonder what it plays like?
Take a look at what Haelian and Boated think of the mod:

After installing the mod, a Chaos Gate will appear in the Crossroads, which will allow you to experience Zagreus' journey through the Underworld as Melinoë.

It is highly recommended to complete the true ending of Hades before playing with this mod, as not all story events are included.

## Installation

In order to use this mod you _must_ have Hades installed on your system at all times when playing Hades II.
The mod will not work without it.
If you have Hades and Hades II installed in different parent folders, please refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Configuration) wiki page for instructions on how to ensure the mod can discover your Hades installation.
You must start the game once to generate the configuration file.

You **must** uninstall your Hades mods by renaming the `Mods` folder and running `modimporter.exe` before installing this mod!

You can install this mod just like any other Hades II mod available on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/), the recommended mod manager is [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/ebkr/r2modman/).
Install r2modman by using `Manual Download` on the linked page, and running the setup executable in the downloaded `.zip` file.

Afterwards, you can find *Zagreus' Journey* on the `Online` tab in r2modman, or use `Install with Mod Manager` on the [mod's Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Zagreus_Journey/).
The mod manager will automatically install any other mods this mod needs to work correctly.
Start the game through the mod manager to make sure mods are enabled - use the `Start Modded` button on the top left.

Starting the game the first time with the mod enabled will install a number of files.
**This may take some time depending on your hardware, and the game will display a black screen during this time.**
You can follow along the installation progress in the console window that opens when playing the game modded.

If the mod was installed successfully, a popup will open in the Training Grounds to let you know.

This mod requires an additional 1GB of disk space.

If you have Hades and Hades II installed in different parent folders, such as through different storefronts (Steam/Epic Games/Microsoft Store/Game Pass), you will need to provide the path of your Hades installation in the mod's configuration file in your mod manager.
Set the `hadesGameFolder` configuration option to the folder where Hades is installed (such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hades` if installed through Steam, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\Games\Hades` if installed through Epic Games, or `C:/Xbox/Hades` for Microsoft Store/Game Pass).

If you would like more information or experience any issues, please refer to the [Installation](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Installation-&-Uninstallation) wiki page.

**Before removing** the mod from r2modman, you must first uninstall it through the `uninstall` configuration setting, to prevent any issues with leftover files.
Only uninstall the mod while in the Crossroads to prevent issues.

## Configuration

Note that the configuration file is only created after the first game start with the mod enabled in your mod manager.
If you need to make any changes (such as to the `hadesGameFolder` setting), you will need to start the game once first to generate the config file.

You can find an explanation of all options [on this wiki page](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Configuration).

## Feedback & Bug Reports

Though the mod can be played through from start to finish, it is still in a beta state, so there are some missing features, and you may occasionally encounter bugs.

## Integrations with other Mods

Some other mods integrate with *Zagreus' Journey* to provide additional features, alternative functionality, or use the resources introduced by this mod:

- [Hades OST for the Music Maker](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Hades_OST_for_the_Music_Maker/) unlocks songs from Hades' original soundtrack through progression in *Zagreus' Journey*, and buying them from the Music Maker will require resources introduced by this mod.
- [Charon's Tip Jar](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Charons_Tip_Jar/) adds a tip jar to Charon's shop rooms during *Zagreus' Journey* underworld runs.
- [Flip the Arcana](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/ReadEmAndWeep/Flip_the_Arcana_Mod/) adds flipped versions of the Arcana cards with wildly different effects, and will require resources from *Zagreus' Journey* to unlock them if both mods are installed.
