# Zagreus' Journey

> Refer to the [FAQ in the wiki](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki) with any questions before opening an issue.

*Zagreus' Journey* is a mod for Hades II that adds the original route Zagreus took through Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx in the first game to the sequel. <br>
Escape the Underworld as Melinoë, battle familiar foes and bosses using her unique abilities and weapons, meet Zagreus' old friends, and reconnect with your family's past.

<br>
After installing the mod, a Chaos Gate will appear in the Crossroads, which will allow you to experience Zagreus' journey through the Underworld as Melinoë.

It is highly recommended to complete the true ending of Hades before playing with this mod, as not all story events are included.

## Installation

In order to use this mod you _must_ have Hades installed on your system at all times when playing Hades II.
The mod will not work without it.
If you have Hades and Hades II installed in different parent folders, please refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Configuration) wiki page for instructions on how to ensure the mod can discover your Hades installation.

> Please uninstall your Hades mods by renaming the `Mods` folder and running `modimporter.exe` when playing with this mod enabled!

You can install this mod just like any other Hades II mod available on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/), the recommended mod manager is [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/ebkr/r2modman/).
Starting the game the first time with the mod enabled will install a number of files.
This may take some time depending on your hardware, and the game will display a black screen during this time.
You can follow along the installation progress in the console window that opens when playing the game modded.

If the mod was installed successfully, a popup will open in the Training Grounds to let you know.

This mod requires an additional 1GB of disk space.

If you would like more information, refer to the [Installation](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Installation-&-Uninstallation) wiki page.

**Before removing** the mod from r2modman, you must first uninstall it through the `uninstall` configuration setting, to prevent any issues with leftover files.
Only uninstall the mod while in the Crossroads to prevent issues.

## Configuration

If you have Hades and Hades II installed in the same folder, you should not need to change any configuration options.

You can find an explanation of all options [on this wiki page](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Configuration).

## Feedback & Bug Reports

Though the mod can be played through from start to finish, it is still in a beta state, so there are some missing features, and you may occasionally encounter bugs.

Please directly leave bug reports as a [new issue on the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/issues/new?template=bug_report.md), or [start a discussion](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/discussions) for general feedback, suggestions and questions.

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can also join the [Hades II Modding Discord server](https://discord.gg/KuMbyrN) and post in the [#h1-run-h2](https://discord.com/channels/667753182608359424/1443569685407989842) channel.

### Feature Roadmap

Among many smaller improvements and fixes, the following major features are planned for future releases (in no particular order):

- Secret boss fight (you know the one)
- Erebus gates (When there is enough Fear in the Night)
- New incantations for meta-progression on the new route
- New story events and dialogue between Melinoë and other characters from Hades II, concerning the new route
- Displaying statistics for the new route with the Record Keeper
- Additional boons for story NPCs (Sisyphus, Eurydice, Patroclus)

You can track all planned features and fixes on the [project's GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/issues).

## Integrations with other Mods

Some other mods may integrate with *Zagreus' Journey* to provide additional features, alternative functionality, or use the resources introduced by this mod:

- [Hades OST for the Music Maker](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Hades_OST_for_the_Music_Maker/) unlocks songs from Hades' original soundtrack through progression in *Zagreus' Journey*, and buying them from the Music Maker will require resources introduced by this mod.

> Are you developing a mod that integrates with *Zagreus' Journey*, or would like to add such an integration? Let me know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KuMbyrN) in the [#h1-run-h2](https://discord.com/channels/667753182608359424/1443569685407989842) channel.
