# Zagreus' Journey

> Refer to the [FAQ in the wiki](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki) with any questions before opening an issue.

Zagreus' Journey is a mod for Hades II that adds the original route Zagreus took through Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx in the first game. <br>
Escape the Underworld as Melinoë, battle familiar foes and bosses using her unique abilities and weapons, meet Zagreus' old friends, and reconnect with your family's past.

After installing the mod, a Chaos Gate will appear in the Crossroads, which will allow Melinoë to relive Zagreus' journey through the Underworld. 

## Installation

In order to use this mod you _must_ have Hades installed on your system at all times when playing Hades II.
The mod will not work without it.
This mod requires an additional 1GB of disk space.

You can install this mod just like any other Hades II mod available on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/), the recommended mod manager is [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/ebkr/r2modman/).

If you would like more information, refer to the [Installation](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Installation-&-Uninstallation) wiki page.

Before *removing* the mod from r2modman, you must first uninstall it through the `uninstall` configuration setting, to prevent any issues with leftover files.

## Configuration

If you have Hades and Hades II installed in the same folder, you should not need to change any configuration options.

You can find an explanation of all options [on this wiki page](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Configuration).
