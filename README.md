# Zagreus' Journey

> Refer to the [FAQ in the wiki](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki) with any questions before opening an issue.

Zagreus' Journey is a mod for Hades II that adds the original route Zagreus took through Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx in the first game to the sequel. <br>
Escape the Underworld as Melinoë, battle familiar foes and bosses using her unique abilities and weapons, meet Zagreus' old friends, and reconnect with your family's past.

<br>
After installing the mod, a Chaos Gate will appear in the Crossroads, which will allow you to experience Zagreus' journey through the Underworld as Melinoë.

It is highly recommended to complete the true ending of Hades before playing with this mod, as not all story events are included.

## Installation

In order to use this mod you _must_ have Hades installed on your system at all times when playing Hades II.
The mod will not work without it.

You can install this mod just like any other Hades II mod available on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/), the recommended mod manager is [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/ebkr/r2modman/).
Starting the game the first time with the mod enabled will install a number of files.
This may take some time depending on your hardware, and the game will display a black screen during this time.
You can follow along the installation progress in the console window that opens when playing the game modded.

If the mod was installed successfully, a popup will open in the Training Grounds to let you know.

This mod requires an additional 1GB of disk space.

If you would like more information, refer to the [Installation](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Installation-&-Uninstallation) wiki page.

Before *removing* the mod from r2modman, you must first uninstall it through the `uninstall` configuration setting, to prevent any issues with leftover files.
Don't uninstall the mod while in a Hades underworld run.

## Configuration

If you have Hades and Hades II installed in the same folder, you should not need to change any configuration options.

You can find an explanation of all options [on this wiki page](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki/Configuration).

## Feedback & Bug Reports

Though the mod can be played through from start to finish, it is still in a beta state, so there are some missing features, and you may occasionally encounter bugs.

Please directly leave bug reports as a [new issue on the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/issues/new), or [start a discussion](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/discussions) for general feedback, suggestions and questions.
