> Refer to the [FAQ in the wiki](https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes/wiki) with any questions before opening an issue.

Zagreus' Journey is a mod for Hades II that adds the original route Zagreus took through Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx in the first game.
Escape the Underworld as Melinoë, battle familiar foes and bosses using her unique abilities and weapons, meet her brother's old friends, and reconnect with her past.
