## v0.1.2

*Notice: I am aware of ongoing issues with music cutting out or changing suddenly. This is under investigation!*

### Patch Highlights:
- Support for PC Game Pass/Microsoft Store versions of Hades. You will need to provide the path of the Hades folder in the mod config file in your mod manager (such as `C:\Xbox\Hades`).
- Workaround: The game will prompt you to perform a restart if it was unable to load some required files. This can cause crashes, missing assets, or enemies to not deal damage otherwise.

Other fixes and improvements:
- Added a new installation failure screen for the particular case when the Hades installation could not be found, to allow for easier troubleshooting.
- Balancing: Reduced the forward momentum of Theseus' spear spin to attack to make it easier to dodge out of range.
- Balancing: Slightly increased Chariot ram speed.
- Balancing: Increased the time it takes for enemies to start attacking after the player enters a new room in Asphodel.
- Fixed: Opening the Broker screen crashes the game if the mod was temporarily disabled and then enabled again, and the player loaded into the Crossroads inbetween.
- Fixed: Judgment and Crystal Figurine trigger for both Asterius and Theseus, doubling their effects.
- Fixed: Vow of Menance can take effect in Boss encounters.
- Fixed: Meeting Tiny Vermin for the first time could have a longer than expected wait time before the fight begins.
- Fixed: The installation failure screen shows only placeholder text.
- Fixed: The mod does not reinstall itself after it is updated.
- Fixed: The mod shows the "Installation Successful" message on every mod update.
- Workaround: "Crystal" enemies (such as Brimstones) will not spawn their tethers to prevent crashes when attacked by a familiar, or hit by the Polymorph Hex.

## v0.1.1

### Patch Highlights:
- Balancing: Reduced Poison tick rate from every 0.13s to every 0.23s.
