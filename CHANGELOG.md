## v0.2.0

### Introducing: New Crossroads Cosmetics!

*Unlock 40+ new cosmetics for the Crossroads*, including new **Cauldrons**, **Fan Posters** for your tent, **Charms** inspired by Zagreus' companions from the first game, and much more.
All new cosmetics were created by community member @burn, and can be unlocked using resources collected during "Zagreus' Journey" runs after performing a new incantation added to your Cauldron.
