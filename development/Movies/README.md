# Creating new Movies/bink files

Follow this tutorial to create the actual `.bik` file from a `.png` sequence: [BinkFixTutorial](https://github.com/EtchJetty/BinkFixTutorial#now-back-to-bink).
After having created the `.bik`, find a `.bik_atlas` file that has the **same** resolution as the new movie.

Rename your `.bik` and `.bik_atlas` files to have the exact same number of characters in their name as the original `.bik_atlas`.

Open the new `.bik_atlas` file in a hex editor and change the name of the movie to the new name.

That's it.
